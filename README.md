# Mahckoor
#### A Twitter account takeover detector.
## Description
Mahckoor monitors changes in supplied Twitter accounts and analyzes their tweets, and alerts via email & remote logging to SIEM upon detecting signs of account takeover.
## Features
### Current:
1. Support for multi-account monitoring.
2. Periodically monitoring changes in account properties:
