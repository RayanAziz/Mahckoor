# Mahckoor
Twitter account hijacking detection and alerting tool.
## Overview
### Description
**Mahckoor** monitors changes in supplied Twitter accounts and analyzes their tweets. It alerts upon detecting changes on the profile or when suspicious tweets are tweeted. Alerts are sent via email & remote logging to SIEM <sup>so far.</sup>
### Use Case
Automatic monitoring for organaization Twitter accounts to expediate incident response and to fulfill regulation requirements.
## Features
### Current features:
1. Support for monitroing up to 5 accounts concurrently <sup>Twitter API limit, workaround possible if the userbase needed it.</sup>
2. Periodically monitor changes in profile properties:
   - Username
   - Display Name
   - Profile Picture
   - Bio
   - URL
   - Location
   - Pinned Tweet
3. Stream real-time tweets from monitored accounts and analyze them.
   - Support for detecing custom blacklisted words.
   - Support for sending tweeted links to OSINT for analysis <sup>only VT so far.</sup>
6. ŸêAuto setting the frequency for Twitter API queries based on the number of monitored accounts to avoid hitting API rate limits.
7. Maximum detection delay: 12 seconds.
8. Sending alerts via email & remote logging to SIEM on UDP in CEF.
9. Easy to configure and deploy
### Ideas in mind:
1. Detect malformed *config.ini*.
2. Log to a local file.
3. Give options to ignore alerting on some monitors <sup>e.g. don't alert for changes in the profile picture.</sup>
4. Support for matching against the blacklist regardless of character case to reduce list size.
5. Utilize machine/deep learning to detect anamoulous and malicious tweets.
6. Support for analyzing tweet replies to phishing.
7. Alert if sensitive media <sup>as per Twitter judgement</sup> is tweeted, and OCR text in it.
8. Support for more than 5 accounts with 1 Twitter bearer token workaround.
9. Support for more TI & OSINT platforms <sup>urlscan integration with nice features is upcoming.</sup>
